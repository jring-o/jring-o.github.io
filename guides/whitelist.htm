                    <p>When projects are running out of work or are offline for temporary maintenance they are placed on the Greylist.  These projects will not reward Gridcoin until they meet the requirements to be placed back on the whitelist again.  Please see various social media (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Slack) for notices about greylisted projects.</p>
