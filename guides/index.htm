        Solo crunching is for people with a balance of GRC that gives a higher probability of staking a block within 8 weeks. This is currently about 5,000 GRC.
        <br><br>
        Pool crunching is for people with few or no GRC. You will earn GRC with a pool, but you will not earn individual BOINC stats.
        <br><br>
        Staking-only is for people who do not wish to work on distributed computing projects, but want to earn GRC by securing the ledger.

        BOINC&mdash;<a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">The Berkeley Open
        Infrastructure for Network Computing</a>, an open-source middleware
        system, supports volunteer and grid computing. Originally developed to
        support the SETI@home project, it became generalized as a platform for
        other distributed applications in areas as diverse as mathematics,
        linguistics, medicine, molecular biology, climatology, environmental
        science, and astrophysics, among others. BOINC aims to enable researchers
        to tap into the enormous processing resources of multiple personal
        computers around the world.

                    In Gridcoin's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, BOINC rewards are
                    given when users stake along with an additional 10 GRC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To stake and earn your BOINC rewards, a balance of GRC is
                    required.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For monthly staking, a balance of approximately 5000 GRC
                        is recommended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rate you are rewarded for your BOINC work is the rate
                        you mint PoS blocks because BOINC rewards are layered on
                        top of these blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your balance does not affect the amount of the payout,
                        only how frequent. You need to wait around 16 hours for
                        received coins to become eligible to earn staking rewards.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    If you don't want to buy any Gridcoin, you can get some through
                    the faucets or through <a href="#">pool mining</a>.
                    On most exchanges, you need to buy Bitcoin first in order to
